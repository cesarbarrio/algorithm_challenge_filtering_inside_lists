This is an algorithm created to prove experience solving logic problems, 

The idea is to find 4 consecutive letters in the ADN of a person and it would prove that the subject is a mutant (It could be in any direction, right, left, diagonal, down, up) for example this would be the adn: 

  List<String> dna = [
    "ATGCAA",
    "CAGTGC",
    "CTATGT",
    "AGAAGG",
    "GCCCGA",
    "TCCCCG",
    ];
